## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Prediction Markets / Ceres event contracts.** Robinhood Derivatives event-contract
  trading (Prediction Markets) via the same Ceres surface as futures:
  - `get_ceres_accounts()` / `get_event_contract_account_id()` — discover `SWAP`
    accounts (and filter by `rhfAccountNumber`)
  - `get_event_contract_positions()` / `get_event_contract_orders()` /
    `get_event_contract_order()` — list and poll with `contractType=EVENT_CONTRACT`
  - `get_event_contract_fees()` — tentative fee quote (`quantity` or `notionalAmount`;
    prefers FUTURES account id when auto-discovering, matching live capture)
  - `place_event_contract_order()` / `cancel_event_contract_order()` — gated behind
    `allow_live=True`
  - `get_event_contract_quotes()` — `/marketdata/event/contract/quotes/v1/`
  - `get_prediction_markets_navigation()` / `get_prediction_markets_events()` —
    public taxonomy + category event lists
  - Models: `CeresAccount`, `EventContractQuote`, `EventContractOrder`,
    `EventContractPosition`, `PredictionMarketNavNode`
  - Docs: `docs/prediction-markets.md`; tests: `tests/test_event_contracts.py`

  Endpoints reverse-engineered from a live app place capture (Oil WTI Sep 28,
  10 @ 0.77 → FILLED on SWAP account).

## [0.12.3] - 2026-09-17

### Fixed
- **Every link in the README was broken on PyPI.** The README doubles as the PyPI project description, which is rendered without repository context, so a repo-relative path resolves against `pypi.org/project/pyhood/`. That path serves the project page for any sub-path, so the link returns HTTP 200 and looks healthy to a link checker while sending the reader nowhere. Both migration guides, both verification examples and the licence badge were affected; the guide links have been dead since they were added. All are now absolute URLs.

  This is the same defect as the broken logo fixed in 0.12.1. That fix corrected the `<img>` tag and left the anchors, and 0.12.2 was then verified by grepping the built sdist for the guide filename, which proved the text shipped rather than that the link worked.

- `tests/test_readme_links.py` now fails on any repo-relative link or image in the README, so this cannot recur silently.

## [0.12.2] - 2026-09-17

A documentation release. No behaviour changes — cut so the new migration guide and the corrected docstring reach PyPI, which renders the README baked into the uploaded distribution rather than the one on `main`.

### Added
- **Migration guide from [pyrh](https://github.com/robinhood-unofficial/pyrh)**, mapping all 54 public methods on its `Robinhood` class. pyrh has not been committed to since August 2024, and `pyrh` was already a PyPI keyword here with nothing behind it. Three shape differences drive most of the mapping: pyrh exposes a method per quote field where pyhood returns one `Quote`; its thirteen order methods collapse into `buy_stock()`, `sell_stock()` and `order_stock()`; and it re-authenticates with stored credentials where pyhood refreshes from a stored token. Every pyhood method and model attribute referenced is verified to exist, including the four `Quote` fields the guide states are *not* carried over.

### Fixed
- **The note on `buy_stock_by_price()` was stale and wrong.** It said market orders are gated to Robinhood's own app versions, so fractional orders could not work. That recorded the state before `ORDER_FORM_VERSION` was found; the 0.11.0 changelog, dated the same day, records the fix. The docstring now states what is actually known: the gate was the missing `order_form_version` and it is now sent, while the fill itself remains unverified, because a fractional order is a market order and executes immediately.

## [0.12.1] - 2026-08-12

A documentation release. No behaviour changes — cut so the corrected README reaches PyPI, which renders the description baked into the uploaded distribution rather than the one on `main`.

### Changed
- **IPO Access verified against a live offering.** Four of these endpoints had never been seen with real data, because they 404 when no offering exists. RVII (Robinhood Ventures Fund II) was in its order book on 2026-08-12 at `ipo_access_status` `price_finalized`, listing the next day.
  - `get_ipo_access_cards()` and `get_ipo_access_order_entry()` return populated data; both shapes are now asserted in tests rather than guessed. The card carries the ticker in `title` and the offer price in `subtitle`; `order_entry.context` carries `phase`, `instrument_symbol`, `ipo_access_cob_deadline`, `has_cob_deadline_passed`, `user_is_enrolled` and `available_buying_power`.
  - `get_ipo_access_summary()` is now marked unconfirmed. It 404s against a live offering, as do seven other spellings of the path on the same base that serves `web_order_entry` successfully. Either the route is stage-specific or the path is wrong.
  - `get_ipo_access_allocation_results()` 404s before allocations are decided, which is correct behaviour rather than a fault.
  - **`has_ipo_offerings()` reports False during a live offering** once its order book closes — it reflects offerings still open for requests, not whether an IPO exists. Documented, along with the reliable signal: instruments of `type` `pre_ipo` carrying an `ipo_access_status`. Cards and order entry still resolve by instrument ID at that point, so the two must not be chained.

### Fixed
- **The logo was a broken image on PyPI.** The README referenced it with a repo-relative path, which PyPI does not resolve — it renders the README but has no access to repository assets. It now uses an absolute raw URL, which is what this release exists to publish.

### Removed
- The three terminal recordings embedded in the README. They did not read well on the page. The VHS tapes that produce them are kept under `assets/demo/`, so restoring them later is one command per recording rather than a re-shoot.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-09

Adds a command line. `pyhood setup login` and `pyhood setup crypto` replace the copy-paste snippets that previously lived in the README — including one that printed your Crypto API private key to the terminal.

### Added
- **`pyhood` command** — installed as a console script, and equivalent to `python -m pyhood`
  - `pyhood version` prints the installed version
  - Suggested commands in output match how pyhood was invoked, rather than always naming the module form
- **`pyhood setup`** — guided credential setup, replacing the copy-paste snippets in the README
  - `setup login` establishes a session. The stored session is tried first, so a valid or refreshable one needs no password at all; only when that fails does it prompt, handling MFA and device approval.
  - `setup crypto` generates an Ed25519 key pair, shows only the public half for registration, reads the API key Robinhood issues, writes both owner-only, and then makes one signed read-only call to confirm the pair is accepted. That last step is the point: writing a file proves nothing, and without it a mistyped or placeholder key is not discovered until a real request fails with an authentication error that reads like a service outage.
  - `setup` with no target reports what is configured — which source credentials resolve from, file permissions, and whether the private key is a real Ed25519 key. No network calls, and lengths and validity only, never values.
  - Secrets are read with `getpass` and there are deliberately no `--password` or `--api-key` options, since arguments are visible to other processes via `ps` and are recorded by the shell. The crypto private key goes from generation directly to disk and is never displayed.
  - Existing crypto credentials are not replaced without `--force` — overwriting would orphan a key that still works.
  - Available programmatically as `pyhood.onboarding.crypto_status()`, `session_status()` and `print_status()`.

- **Verification examples** — `examples/verify_stocks.py` and `examples/verify_crypto.py`, read-only checks that confirm credentials work and print what is wrong when they do not. Both are restricted to data that is safe to publish: quotes, an options chain, market hours, fee tier and counts. No positions, balances or account numbers.
- Ctrl-C at a credential prompt now exits with one line instead of a traceback, which on a shared screen would also expose local paths. `EOFError` is treated the same way.
- `setup login` explains the device approval step *before* asking for a password, rather than after. Previously anyone who read ahead or backed out never learned they needed their phone.

### Fixed
- **`CryptoAccount.fee_tier` was always empty** — fees arrive as a `fee_tier_status` object (`fee_ratio`, `thirty_day_volume`, `next_fee_tier_ratio`, `next_fee_tier_threshold`), and pyhood read a `fee_tier` key the API does not send. `fee_tier` is now rendered from the ratio (`'0.95%'`), the underlying figures are exposed as fields, and `api_tradable` is read from `is_api_tradable`. The existing test mocked `"fee_tier": "standard"` — a shape the API never returns — so it passed against code that could not work.

### Changed
- The README's key-generation snippet printed the private key to the terminal, where it lands in scrollback. It now points at `pyhood setup crypto`, with the manual file format kept as a fallback.
- Quick Start no longer opens with a hardcoded password — it uses the stored session.
- README now carries three terminal recordings — install, stock setup, crypto setup — each reproducible from a checked-in VHS tape.
- Python 3.14 added to the CI matrix and the PyPI classifiers. The full suite passes on it; `requires-python` already allowed it, so the package was installable on a version nothing tested.
- **Install instructions were wrong for most systems.** They gave a bare `pip install pyhood`, which Homebrew and Debian-based distributions refuse outright as an [externally managed environment](https://peps.python.org/pep-0668/). The macOS case is worse: `python3` is 3.9, and since a virtualenv inherits the version of the interpreter that creates it, `python3 -m venv` there yields a 3.9 environment where the install fails with `no matching distribution found` rather than a version error. Both the README and Getting Started now check the version first and name an explicit interpreter.

### Fixed
- The README's portfolio example still called `get_portfolio_historicals()`, which raises `APIError` as of 0.11.0. It now shows `get_portfolio_performance()`.

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-09

A repair release. Every fix below was found by running pyhood against the live Robinhood API. Each broken feature shipped with passing tests that mocked a response shape the API never returns, so CI stayed green while the feature was unusable.

### Security
- **Session tokens were written world-readable** — `~/.pyhood/session.json` holds live access and refresh tokens but was created with the process umask, producing `-rw-r--r--` on a default macOS setup. Any user or process on the machine could read it and act on the account. Credential files are now created `0600` inside a `0700` directory, the mode is applied at creation so contents are never briefly exposed, and loading an over-permissive file logs a warning with the `chmod` to run.

### Fixed

**Orders**
- **Market orders, fractional orders and trailing stops were all rejected** — Robinhood refuses orders that omit `order_form_version`, responding "Your app version is missing important stock trading updates". Despite the wording this is the *order form* version, not a client version. pyhood now sends `7`. Any value from 2 upward is accepted; `1` and omission are refused. robin_stocks sends `4` on ordinary stock orders, which works — but omits it on `order_trailing_stop`, so trailing stops fail there.
- **Rejected orders were reported as successful** — `order_stock()` and `order_option()` only treated a response as an error when it carried a `detail` or `error` key, but Robinhood returns field-level validation errors (`{"field": ["message"]}`) that have neither. Any such rejection returned an `Order` with a blank id and no exception, so callers believed the order was placed. Both now raise when the response has no `id`.
- Trailing stop rejections now raise a specific `OrderError` explaining that Robinhood gates the feature to its own app versions, rather than surfacing the raw server text.
- Passing both a `price` and a trail is rejected up front — Robinhood does not support trailing stop limit orders.

**Positions and portfolio**
- **Position P&L was wrong, reporting gains on losing positions** — `get_positions()` read `average_buy_price`, which Robinhood returns as `0` for settled positions. Cost basis therefore came out as zero and `unrealized_pl` degenerated to equity. It now falls back to `clearing_average_cost` and prefers the broker's own `clearing_cost_basis`, matching what the app displays. Caught by comparing pyhood's output against the Robinhood web UI for the same position.
- `get_positions()` no longer fetches each instrument to resolve a symbol — the positions payload already carries it, saving a request per position.

**Crypto**
- **Crypto orders could not be placed** — the payload omitted the required `client_order_id` idempotency key, and spread `order_config` flat instead of nesting it under `{type}_order_config` as the API expects. The README example demonstrated the wrong shape.
- **`place_order()` sent `account_number` in the body** — the API requires it as a query parameter and rejects the body form with "The account_number parameter is required". Notably it is absent from `OrderRequest` in Robinhood's published spec.
- **Crypto orders parsed almost every field wrong** — the API reports `state`, `filled_asset_quantity`, `average_price` and `fee_charged`, and keeps the requested size and price inside `{type}_order_config`. pyhood read `status`, `quantity`, `price`, `filled_quantity`, `average_filled_price` and `fee` at the top level, so a real order came back with an empty status, zero quantity and no price. The three construction sites are now one `_parse_order()` helper, which also stops the old code raising `ValueError` when a timestamp is absent.
- **`get_trading_pairs()` reported every field wrong** — the API uses `asset_code`/`quote_code`/`quote_increment`/`asset_increment`, and reports availability as `status` plus `is_api_tradable`. pyhood read `base_currency`, `price_increment`, `tradable` and similar, so every pair came back with empty currencies, zero increments and `tradable=False`. `TradingPair` now also exposes `api_tradable`, which is what actually governs whether a pair can be ordered through the API.
- **Crypto market-data calls failed authentication** — the signature covers the path *including* its query string, but pyhood signed the bare path and let `requests` append the query separately. Every parameterised crypto endpoint returned "Authentication failed".
- **Crypto quotes always returned 0.0** — `get_best_bid_ask()` read `bid_price`/`ask_price`; the API returns `bid`/`ask`.
- **`get_best_bid_ask()` sent the wrong parameter** — `symbols=` comma-joined, where the API wants `symbol=` repeated; it rejected the former as "Malformed symbol parameter".
- **`get_estimated_price()` returned zeros** — the estimate is wrapped in a `results` list, and the fee is `est_fee`.

### Added
- **`is_market_open()`** — whether trading is open right now, for the regular or extended session. Uses the New York trading date rather than the UTC date, so it stays correct during the evening. Orders placed while closed are queued rather than rejected, which is easy to mistake for a hang.
- **Extended and 24-hour trading sessions** — `market_hours` on `buy_stock()`, `sell_stock()` and `order_stock()`, accepting `regular_hours`, `extended_hours` or `all_day_hours`. `extended_hours` is derived from it, since Robinhood rejects orders where the two disagree.
- **Trailing stop orders** — `buy_stock(..., trail_amount=)` / `trail_percent=`, and the same on `sell_stock()` and `order_stock()`. Posted as JSON, since the nested `trailing_peg` cannot survive form encoding. **Robinhood currently rejects these from third-party clients** — see Fixed above.
- **Fractional orders by dollar amount** — `buy_stock_by_price()` and `sell_stock_by_price()`.
- **Multi-leg option spreads** — `order_option_spread()` for debit and credit spreads, with per-leg ratios.
- **Interest, fees and transfers** — `get_interest_payments()`, `get_margin_interest()`, `get_subscription_fees()`, `get_unified_transfers()`. All verified against live data except margin interest, where the endpoint is confirmed but the account has no charges to observe.
- **Crypto credential resolution** — `CryptoClient()` now takes no arguments and resolves credentials from `RH_CRYPTO_API_KEY` / `RH_CRYPTO_PRIVATE_KEY` or `~/.pyhood/crypto.env` (override with `PYHOOD_CRYPTO_ENV`), alongside the existing session file. `load_credentials()` and `credentials_available()` are exported. Explicit arguments still take precedence.
- **`get_portfolio_performance()`** — the bonfire chart view model that replaced the retired historicals endpoint. Returned unmapped: its y values are returns rather than equity, so mapping it onto `PortfolioCandle` would mean inventing figures the endpoint does not provide.
- **`cancel_all_option_orders()`** — mirrors the existing stock version.
- **CSV export** — `export_stock_orders()` and `export_option_orders()`, accepting a file or directory path.
- **`unlink_bank_account()`** — irreversible; not exercised against a live account.
- Migration guide from robin_stocks, with every referenced method verified to exist.

How order placement was verified: stock and option orders are covered by asserting the outgoing request payload, not by placing live orders. Crypto order placement is verified end to end against the live API with a limit buy priced far below market, which rests unfilled and is then cancelled — the full round trip without a trade executing.

### Changed
- Promoted from `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha` to `4 - Beta` on PyPI — 312 tests, CI across Python 3.10-3.13, and eleven releases
- PyPI keywords now include `robinhood-api`, `robin_stocks`, `robin-stocks` and `pyrh`, so the package is findable by people searching for the libraries they are migrating from

### Removed
- **`get_portfolio_historicals()`** now raises `APIError` — Robinhood retired `/portfolios/historicals/`, which returns 404 for every parameter combination. It had a passing test that mocked the dead endpoint. robin_stocks calls the same URL.
- **`CryptoClient.get_historicals()`** now raises `APIError` — the Crypto Trading API has no historicals endpoint. Every candidate path returns 404 and it is absent from Robinhood's published spec. Its tests mocked an endpoint that does not exist.

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Futures contracts and quotes never worked** — `get_futures_contract()` raised `SymbolNotFound` for every valid symbol, and `get_futures_quote()` failed with it
  - The contract endpoint wraps its body in a `result` envelope with camelCase keys; the parser expected a flat snake_case object
  - The quotes endpoint returns `data[0].data`; the parser read a non-existent `results` list
  - Field mapping corrected: `description` (not `simple_name`), `expiration` (not `expiration_date`); `/ESZ26:XCME` is normalized to `ESZ26` and `FUTURES_STATE_ACTIVE` to `active`
  - `tick_size`, `underlying` and `asset_class` are not returned by the endpoint and now default rather than being read from absent keys
  - Existing tests used a fabricated response shape, so the whole futures surface failed in practice while CI stayed green
  - Verified live against ES, NQ and MES contracts

### Added
- **IPO Access** — read Robinhood's retail IPO allocation program
  - `get_ipo_access_list()` / `has_ipo_offerings()` — current offerings, or the empty state when there are none
  - `get_ipo_access_cards(instrument_ids)` — cards for one or more instruments
  - `get_ipo_access_summary()`, `get_ipo_access_order_entry()`, `get_ipo_access_allocation_results()`, `get_ipo_access_trade_receipt()` — offering view models
  - `get_ipo_access_orders(start_date=...)` — typed `Order` objects for orders flagged `is_ipo_access_order`
  - View models are returned as raw dicts: their structure is deeply nested and offering-dependent, and four of the six endpoints 404 outside a live offering, so their populated shapes are unverified. The list, cards and orders paths are verified against the live API.
  - Requesting shares is not wrapped — an IPO order is an ordinary equity order and the submission payload could not be verified without a live offering
- `get_futures_positions()` — open futures positions. The endpoint (`ceres/v1/accounts/{id}/positions/`) was previously undiscovered; robin_stocks_v2 ships a stub that returns None. Route and `results` envelope verified live; records are returned unmapped because no populated position was observable.
- `get_futures_quote_by_id(contract_id)` — quote a contract directly, skipping the symbol lookup
- `get_futures_order_info(order_id)` — fetch a single futures order by ID

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`start_date` on order history** — avoid paging through years of orders to reach recent ones (re: [#15](https://github.com/jamestford/pyhood/issues/15))
  - `get_stock_orders(start_date=...)`, `get_option_orders(start_date=...)`, `get_futures_orders(start_date=...)`, `get_filled_futures_orders(start_date=...)`
  - Accepts a `datetime` or ISO-8601 string (`'2026-01-01'` or a full timestamp); naive values are treated as UTC
  - Requested server-side via `created_at[gte]` so the API returns fewer pages, and re-applied client-side so an endpoint that ignores the filter still returns correctly filtered results
  - Server-side filtering is confirmed working on options orders; stock and futures endpoints could not be verified against live data, hence the local fallback
  - Omitting `start_date` preserves existing behaviour exactly — no param is sent
  - 8 new tests (235 total)

### Changed
- **Source distribution reduced from 6.8 MB to 68 KB** — the sdist bundled `assets/`, `docs/` and `.github/`, of which ~6.5 MB was logo source images. It now ships source, tests, README, changelog and licence via an explicit include list. The wheel is unchanged at 46 KB.
- Example account numbers in the IRA documentation and in the `get_positions()` docstring are now placeholders rather than literal values.

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **`login()` crashed on Windows** — `AttributeError: module 'signal' has no attribute 'SIGALRM'` (fixes [#16](https://github.com/jamestford/pyhood/issues/16))
  - The login timeout was armed with `signal.SIGALRM`, which exists only on Unix
  - The alarm is now best-effort: skipped when `SIGALRM` is unavailable, so login works on Windows
  - Also skipped when `login()` is called off the main thread, where `signal.signal()` raises `ValueError`
  - Timeouts are still enforced on those platforms by the verification poll loop and per-request HTTP timeouts
  - Alarm setup/teardown moved into a context manager, so the handler is always restored
  - 4 new tests (227 total) simulating a Windows environment and a worker thread

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **`get_news()` crashed on every real call** — `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'get'` (fixes [#17](https://github.com/jamestford/pyhood/issues/17))
  - `related_instruments` entries are bare instrument IDs, but were parsed as dicts
  - IDs are now resolved to ticker symbols via the instruments endpoint, cached per call
  - Dict entries and instrument URLs are also accepted, so the parser tolerates all observed shapes
  - A malformed or non-list `related_instruments`, or a failed lookup, no longer raises
  - Existing tests only ever supplied dicts — the one shape the API does not return — so CI stayed green while the feature was unusable in 0.7.0
  - 6 new tests (222 total), verified against live API data

### Added
- `get_news(symbol, resolve_symbols=True)` — pass `resolve_symbols=False` to skip symbol resolution and get raw instrument IDs back, avoiding one request per unique instrument

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Debit Card Transactions** — Query Cash Management debit card transaction history (re: [#14](https://github.com/jamestford/pyhood/issues/14))
  - `get_card_transactions(card_type)` returns all debit card transactions, with optional `'pending'`/`'settled'` filter
  - Uses the `minerva.robinhood.com/history/transactions/` endpoint (same auth token)
  - Typed model: `CardTransaction` (id, description, amount, category, direction, state, initiated_at, completed_at, merchant)
  - 3 new tests (217 total)

### Fixed
- **SNDK earnings edge case** — `get_earnings()` now handles `eps: null` payloads without raising an exception
- **Equity options expiration fallback** — `get_options_expirations()` now falls back to an equity instrument's `tradable_chain_id` when the standard chain lookup returns no expiration dates
- This fixes real-world symbol-specific failures like SNDK in downstream scanners

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-29
